mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:#333333'>“In the second half of the twentieth century, 
an innovation came along that would transform the way the world did business. At first, some people wrote 
it off as a fad. Others kept at it, convinced that it was going to have a huge impact.”
<br>
This is how Bill Gates’ opens up a blog post last week on The Gates Notes. Gates goes on to discuss the 
book “The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger,” by Marc 
Levinson, a former Economist editor. While we may think that Gates is talking about some other technology 
with this introduction, he’s actually talking about the shipping industry – specifically the shipping 
container.<p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:#333333'>The book discusses the beginnings of 
container shipping and how it changed global trade and the global economy as a whole. The interesting 
point that Gates brings up though, is that this book also challenges commonly held views about business 
and the role that innovation plays. “For example, you often hear that it’s a big advantage to get into a 
particular business early. But in both software and shipping, that wasn’t necessarily the case,” writes 
Gates.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:#333333'>He goes on to describe the conditions that make 
it possible for innovation to take place, whether it be for the development of the container or not, as a 
lot of this can depend on government involvement. It’s unlikely that shipping companies in the 50s and 60s 
could raise enough capital without governmental support to invest in the industry as a whole, such as 
investing in new cranes or deepening the waterways.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:#333333'>
The complicated process of innovation also holds true when it comes to setting standards, as it’s difficult 
to know where standards will come from, whether it be for the shipping container or the Internet. “Few people 
would have predicted that the Internet protocol would grow out of a university research project funded by the 
U.S. Department of Defense,” writes Gates.<br>

<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:#333333'>
Gates mentions that in the 1950s, few people understood how important the shipping container would be in 
shaping the global economy, and mentions that this is almost always the case with any type of innovation. 
“It’s hard to predict which ones will fizzle and which ones will change the world,” he writes.

<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:#333333'>
The shipping container was a revolutionary innovation. What do you think will be the next big industry 
innovation that will be as impactful as the evolution of the shipping container?
<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:#333333'>
We can speculate, but only time will tell. As Gates says, “You never know where the next shipping 
container will come from.”
