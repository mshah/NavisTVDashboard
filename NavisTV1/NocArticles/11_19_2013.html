The complexity and impact of data migration can cause data issues in the TOS. 
</span> <span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";font-weight:bold; color:#22B14C;'>
Incorrect data can cause major
 operational problems until the data is cleaned up or the affected transactions are passed through the system.
 Migrated data should be thoroughly “exercised” during the testing phase.
 </span> <span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>
 Based on our experience, it is 
essential that implementation teams test all combinations of container handling actions including gate transactions, 
yard to yard moves, vessel moves and rail. This process will help identify any data-related problems that need to be 
resolved prior to go-live.

When planning your data migration process, it is essential to do the following:
<br><br>
</span> <span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";font-weight:bold; color:#22B14C;'>
Migrate data frequently  </span> <span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>
through your implementation process to test the process and refresh your data sets where it makes sense.
</span> <span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";font-weight:bold; color:#22B14C;'>
Avoid migrating historical data unless it is operationally required. </span> <span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>
Archive your old system data so that it can be accessed through alternative means.
<span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";font-weight:bold; color:#22B14C;'>
Ensure your data cleanup process is extensive </span> <span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>
and that you use your testing procedures to check that the migrated data can be processed correctly.
<span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";font-weight:bold; color:#22B14C;'>
Consider migrating data for containers on-site and then reprocess EDI messages (e.g. EDI350, UIIA files, Fleet Files, BAPLIEs) after the inventory has been loaded.
