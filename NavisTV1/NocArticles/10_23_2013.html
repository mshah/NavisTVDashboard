This fall, we are featuring members of the Navis Professional Services team on proven best practices that help terminals maximize the success of 
their TOS go-lives.   For week two’s installment, we are focusing on the importance of using a phased approach to technology changes.
<br><br>
Most terminals run on multiple, interacting and integrated systems, including Position Detection Systems (PDS), Quay Crane Optical Character Recognition 
(QC-OCR), Gate Operating Systems (GOS) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), to name a few. Going live on a new TOS and other systems at the same time 
is very complex and adds a level of risk that can be averted by phasing in the new systems after the initial TOS goes live.
<br><br>
Implementing a new GOS, PDS, and automated equipment at the same time as the TOS may be mandatory in a new facility.  Existing terminals may have the 
option of using a phased approach to their technology changes and should consider doing so. There doesn’t have to be a long period of time between the 
phases, but introducing incremental change can help mitigate change management risk and help ensure the terminal operators have time to adapt, master 
new processes and are better prepared to quickly handle any operational issues that may arise.

With a phased approach, the implementation project establishes the basic systems before implementing more complex systems and additional optimization 
functionality.</span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>
<br><br>
In addition to a phased approach, terminals implementing complex software integration projects should try to plan their go-live activities during a 
time of lower operational activity. Terminals that can proactively control operational volumes in the weeks and months before or around the scheduled 
go-live can mitigate any initial decline in productivity as users become used to new systems and processes.
