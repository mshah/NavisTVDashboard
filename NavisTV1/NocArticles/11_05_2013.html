The IT infrastructure is the backbone to any terminal operation.  It is a critical component for a successful implementation and should be tested and 
evaluated as to its readiness to support the new systems.  As such, all aspects of IT infrastructure and how it impacts the operation of the container 
terminal are fundamental to implementing new systems.
<br><br>
From our experience with TOS implementations around the world, there are four key things all terminals should do to ensure IT infrastructure readiness:
<br><br></span><span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";font-weight:bold; color:#22B14C;'>
Make sure there is a comprehensive understanding of the terminal’s IT architecture,</span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>
 including the hardware (servers, computers, and wired and wireless 
networks), applications and container handling equipment (CHE). 
Develop and maintain an architectural design model that reflects a clear understanding 
of all of the components of the IT architecture and how they connect and interact with one another. 
If done correctly, this will help plan for system 
outages and process changes.
<br><br></span><span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";font-weight:bold; color:#22B14C;'>
Verify the IT infrastructure is sized such that it is ‘fit for purpose’</span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>
and will support the business requirements of the terminal. This is especially important when considering integrated solutions such as the TOS working with a 
GOS or a PDS system. The volumes, sequencing and robustness of the interaction between the TOS and one or more other sub-systems can cause problems if 
the messaging between these systems is not working seamlessly. Even when system(s) are working ‘as designed’ individually, operational problems can 
occur when systems start working together. This can create gate congestion, yard congestion and significant operational exceptions.
<br><br></span><span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";font-weight:bold; color:#22B14C;'>
Make certain the IT infrastructure supports the terminal’s requirements, </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>
including the individual applications and the interaction between applications, 
infrastructure and the CHE. The majority of configuration challenges typically occur with databases, wireless networks and TOS configuration (nodes, etc.).
