It is my pleasure to announce that Da Chan Bay Terminal One successfully went live with SPARCS N4 v2.4.6.3 on Monday, 
18th November 2013 with all modules of N4, N4 Mobile, ECN4 and XPS.
</span> <span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>
<br><br>
MTL terminated SPARCS support since 2008. The return of Navis completely replaced their internally developed TOS.  
This proves Navis is best strategy partner of MTL.  The O&A sessions were commenced at 5th November 2012 and were 
completed at 19th March 2013. <span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";font-weight:bold; color:#22B14C;'>
 The project started in Mar 2013 and completed in Nov 2013, a total duration of just 10 months!    
</span> <span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>
<br><br>
The first N4 implementation in China.  A lot of Chinese existing and potential customers are watching this project very closely. 
<span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";font-weight:bold; color:#22B14C;'>
The success of the delivery creates a momentum and selling point to the China market.
</span> <span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>
Provides confidence to the MTL executives. The successful golive of DCB forged confidence and trust between MTL and Navis. 
This strengthens our partnership and will lead to more opportunities within MTL.
This is also a major N4 implementation in APAC.  We are working with Accenture in this project.  
This will lead to further co-operation and partnership in the region.
