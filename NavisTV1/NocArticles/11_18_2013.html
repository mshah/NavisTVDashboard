DP World has been well regarded as an innovator in the container terminal industry; 65 marine terminals 
across six continents fall under DP World. As a whole, DP World handled more than 56 million TEU across 
its global portfolio in 2012. </span> <span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";font-weight:bold; color:#22B14C;'>
With its committed pipeline of developments and expansions, capacity is 
expected to rise to more than 100 million TEU by 2020, in line with market demand.

“As a part of our upgrade, the TOS has been standardized using N4, allowing us to interface with Australian 
customs, transport operators, custom brokers, freight forwarders, port authorities and our shipping line 
clients,” said DP World Australia Managing Director, Ganesh Raj.
</span> <span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";font-weight:bold; color:#22B14C;'>
“DP World is developing a world class automated terminal comprised of eight modules, which will drive 
consistent operational performance and boost productivity,” shared Raj. 
</span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>“Over the last 12 months, we 
have been working with leading construction firm, York Civil, to deliver this project. By developing a 
new yard area, we’ll be using a combination of automatic stacking cranes that will interact with shuttle
 carriers to maximize terminal capacity and improve operational efficiency.”

In the past, DP World Australia’s terminals operated on disparate technology platforms. As a national 
container terminal operator, DP World’s strategy is to design IT solutions that best fit the needs of 
each terminal while maintaining some supporting centralized IT services. 
</span> <span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";font-weight:bold; color:#22B14C;'>
“Standardizing systems such as 
the TOS allows us to be agile, flexible and responsive to customer needs,” said Raj.  
</span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>With centralization 
and standardization of IT systems as a priority, DP World Australia is able to deliver excellent customer 
service by being an industry innovation leader.
