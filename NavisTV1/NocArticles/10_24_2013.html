Long Beach Container Terminal (LBCT) is amongst the United States’ leading terminal operators in the movement of goods and operational 
sustainability. LBCT operates at the Port of Long Beach which is the second-busiest seaport in the United States managing more than 
$140 billion dollars worth of cargo annually. The port also acts as a major contributor to the local and national economies, as it 
supplies more than 316,000 jobs throughout Southern California and 1.4 million jobs throughout the United States.

Last month, LBCT’s Pier F went live with Navis’ N4 terminal operating system (TOS).

 and the terminal during implementation of the TOS made the process a success, and allowed for a smooth go-live on September 9th. 
 Navis’ TOS was chosen by LBCT in order to streamline terminal operations and prepare for the launch of the Middle Harbor Terminal.

According to Anthony Otto, President and CEO at LBCT, “We were extremely pleased with how smoothly the implementation of N4 went 
at Pier F. Because of the hard work done by the LBCT implementation team and the strong partnership we have with Navis, we were 
able to keep our operations running efficiently during the implementation process.”

The new state-of-the-art terminal at Middle Harbor (scheduled to go-live in Q4 2014) will be fully automated, focusing heavily on 
environmental performance as well as overall terminal efficiency. The $1.2 billion dollar Middle Harbor redevelopment project 
officially kicked-off in 2012 after the Port of Long Beach signed a 40-year, $4.6 billion dollar lease with Orient Overseas 
Container Line (OOCL) and Long Beach Container Terminal (LBCT).
