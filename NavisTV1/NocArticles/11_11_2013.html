It is my pleasure to announce that 
</span><span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";font-weight:bold; color:#22B14C;'>
Generale de Manutention Portuaire (GMP) - Le Havre successfully went live with N4 v2.3.7.3 at Terminal North
</span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'> on Sunday,
 02 November 2013 with Vessel, Yard and Rail Operations.  Gate Operations commenced on Monday, 03 November 2013.
<br><br>
 As our first customer in France which pose unique challenges, it’s taken some time
 and a lot of effort to reach this point.
Navis SN4 has handled GMP’s normal Operational volumes from Day One with 0 serious issues.  There was no drop in operational productivity after startup.  
GMP is already achieving same productivity and Gate turnaround times as before.
<br><br>My sincere thanks for each and everyone’s important contributions.  
Although this project did not allow for a full time, continuous core project team, 
</span><span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";font-weight:bold; color:#22B14C;'>we 
still acted as one -- a dedicated team that established excellent, long term relationships with our customer counterparts.   
</span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>I recognize the effort required with
 numerous late nights/weekends, and accomodating onsite visits even when it required travel directly from another onsite visit. 
Special acknowledgement to:
