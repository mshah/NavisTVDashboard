According to Alex Becce, Terminal and Commercial Manager at DP World Jeddah, 
“The Navis Optimization Modules of Expert Decking and PrimeRoute have helped us to dramatically
 improve the productivity of our operations. Our customers have experienced an improvement in 
 service and we have been able to reduce our operating costs as a result.”

Located on the Red Sea, DP World Jeddah serves as a vital link between the world's busy 
Europe and Asia trade routes. Recognizing the inevitable challenges described above, the 
terminal put an aggressive plan in place to improve its operations. Key aspects focused on
 advancing the visibility of operations, improving overall systems management and reporting
 reliability.  In addition, motivating the work force and improving accountability, teamwork
 and safety has also been key operational goals.

 The specific benefit of PrimeRoute allowed DP World Jeddah to improve its productivity by reducing the 
 travel distance for unladen ITV’s and to increase laden travel. This productivity improvement decreases 
 fuel consumption, while increasing the number of jobs per shift hour, congestion control and visibility 
 of operations. The key benefit of expert decking helped DP World Jeddah better manage general cargo
 allocations and increase the flexibility of its system.
