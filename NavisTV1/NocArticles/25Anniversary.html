<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:#333333'>Looking back to 1988,
it’s hard to believe how far we have come as a company. Offering the industry’s
first terminal operating system (TOS) presents its fair share of pressures and
challenges, but has also afforded us the advantage of setting the industry
standard. Today, despite the many TOS options available to the market, we’re
proud that top terminals around the world continue to select Navis as their TOS of choice.
<br><p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:#333333'>
Much of our success and continued innovation is due to our employees. They’re
as dedicated now as they were in our early years, when unfinished doors were
used for desks and air conditioning was something on our corporate “wish list.”
Navis employees have also faced some unique
experiences, such as earthquakes and tropical disease while on site with
and sizes, requiring our team members to be displaced for extended periods of
customers. We’ve also been involved with complex implementations of all shapes
time to ensure critical systems function as promised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:#333333'>Special credit is also
due to our esteemed team of technologists. Growing our company from just two
people in 1988 to 400 people today who provide engineering, services and
technical support is a major achievement. With their expertise, we’ve delivered
significant upgrades to our operating system over the years, ultimately
transforming the way that container terminals operate globally.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:#333333'>Lastly, our customers
deserve tremendous recognition. They have stood by us as we’ve overcome the
complexities of implementations, tested new waters and invested technology to
move terminals forward. It’s hard to believe that it was over 6 years ago
when Lyttelton Port of Christchurch in New Zealand became the first
SPARCS N4 site to go live. Through that trust, collaboration and partnership,
I’m proud to report that SPARCS N4 technology is now live and/or currently
being deployed at 117 sites in more than 50 countries around the world.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:#333333'>
Today, we can confidently say that Navis has become the trusted industry standard
to the container transportation industry across the globe.
I’m proud to be part of a company that has achieved so much in the past 25
years, and I look forward to what our future will hold as the industry
progresses, and as we move forward with it.
