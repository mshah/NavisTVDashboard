This fall, we are featuring members of the Navis Professional Services team on proven best practices that help terminals maximize the success of their TOS go-lives.   
For this week’s installment, we are focusing on minimizing customization of new systems.
<br><br>
An essential implementation best practice is to align your terminal’s business processes to the capabilities of the solution as much as possible. 
In projects where the terminal has deep knowledge of an existing TOS, and little knowledge of N4, it is tempting to heavily customize N4 until it 
matches the old existing TOS. This is NOT recommended. </span><span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";font-weight:bold; color:#22B14C;'>
Enhancement of TOS software is always enticing in any new system implementation; however, 
excessive customization also introduces a great deal of risk.</span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>
<br><br>
New software customizations require significant additional testing overhead for the project team. Because they must be tailored to a specific site, 
these customizations don’t have the benefit of having been “road tested” by other customers in the past, and as such are more likely to produce potential 
problems. Customizations also introduce unnecessary complexity into the software. While Navis QA has tested the base functionality of the software in great 
depth, it is often difficult or impossible to anticipate the impact that extensive customization will have on the behavior of the base software.
<br><br></span><span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";font-weight:bold; color:#22B14C;'>
It often takes extensive planning and deliberate buy-in from key stakeholders at the terminal to avoid extensive customization of the TOS.  To 
achieve this level of internal support, it is important to ensure that the key stakeholders understand N4 software fully by engaging them in 
super-user trainings, ideally before business analysis commences.
