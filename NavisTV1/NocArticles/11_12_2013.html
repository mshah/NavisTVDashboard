One of the main objectives of system testing is to help determine whether the TOS will work in combination with new
 processes, procedures, other systems and users, in real-world scenarios. The test strategy must carefully outline all
 aspects of the business processes that need "testing".

Too often, testing is either de-emphasised or targeted too 
 narrowly. </span>
 <span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>Basic “kicking the tire” tests are performed by 
 running very typical examples, or tests are limited to 
 “happy day” scenarios. A formal test plan that describes what needs to be run is important. In addition, these tests 
 should be run by a team of individuals that come from different areas of the operation.

Navis recommends comprehensive and advanced test plans to mitigate risks in most TOS and integration implementations. 
A test plan should include a suite of specific test cases including acceptance criteria for each case, a written plan 
for handling defects and how to handle exceptions.

Developing an automated testing strategy, in combination with 
emulation testing, is an effective way to reduce the on-going cost of regression testing.

to test and validate that the automated decisions the TOS is making is optimally 
configured for the specifics of the terminal.

Systems Performance (Stress) Testing </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>
to test representative and exceptional volumes of transactions in order to

Systems Integration Testing</span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>
, including all major sub-systems, should be tested together (end-to-end testing) to 
ensure that the processes, systems and people working together in a live operational environment can do so successfully.
