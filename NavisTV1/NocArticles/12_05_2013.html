As we have been discussing, the implementation of a new TOS and integrated systems is a complex and can be a challenging proposition.  
No matter how much your systems are tested before the go-live, there is always the risk of unforeseen and unanticipated events that 
can cause system outages.  As such, it is critical to have an operational recovery plan in place to help restore the system as 
quickly as possible. </span>

 <span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";font-weight:bold; color:#22B14C;'>
Ensure you have clear ownership and escalation procedures in place </span> <span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>
that will help you quickly and efficiently identify, report, and resolve system issues that can result in operational problems.

Ensure systems monitoring is in place </span> <span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>
to determine whether or not the system and which part of the system, is either down or is in the process of failing. It is often possible to identify system failures “in process” allowing you to take the necessary action to avoid the failure or start the recovery process.  This helps to minimize the impact on the operations. Navis recommends using Hyperic HQ or another enterprise monitoring application for ongoing system monitoring.  Examples of this may be monitoring the database performance, queue sizes, memory usage of N4 or other systems.

Establish a clear set of recovery procedures </span> <span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>
for when a system (or parts of a system) may be down.  Your ability to get your systems recovered quickly coupled with your ability to “reset” your operations is critical. This may involve setting up automated resetting or rebooting of some of your systems in order to help reduce systems downtime.
<br></span>
<span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";font-weight:bold; color:#22B14C;'>
Determine procedures for how to bring operations back up 
</span> <span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>to speed as quickly as possible. 
You’ll need to understand the processes and sequencing for stopping, reconciling and restarting operations to ensure that you remain in synch with the information in your business applications. Recovery procedures can vary dramatically depending upon which systems and operations are running.
<br><br>
Have a communication plan in place for internal and external stakeholders when dealing with system outages.
<span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";font-weight:bold; color:#22B14C;'>
Ensure an adequate Disaster Recovery Strategy is ready, tested and in place prior to go-live.
