Having a limited or no monitoring solution in place for a terminal’s IT infrastructure represents a significant risk to 
system downtime and outages. There are a several tools that can be implemented with the N4 deployment that will assist with 
systems monitoring. </span> <span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";font-weight:bold; color:#22B14C;'>
Monitoring tools for the JAVA processes (N4, bridge and EDN4 JAVA Management Extensions (JMX)) are enabled 
by default. JMX enables you to monitor memory and thread usage.  </span> <span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>
In addition, it provides other diagnostic options, such as a 
detailed view of all available MBeans.
<br><br>
N4 also provides a plug-in for Hyperic HQ, an open source, enterprise level systems monitoring tool. The implementation of Hyperic 
HQ is a pre-requisite for all N4 installations (unless customer has an equivalent or better monitoring tool implemented). 
</span> <span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";font-weight:bold; color:#22B14C;'>Hyperic 
enables the creation of dashboards that show the health of all of the major systems and the interfaces between these systems. 
</span> <span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>Any 
drops in systems performance can then be identified more easily and managed proactively. Terminals can then collect basic metrics 
for N4 components, including XPS and the second level cache (Hazelcast). The Hyperic plug-in can also be used to develop more 
detailed dashboards, parse log files and to fully utilize N4 MBeans for customized alerts and reports. 
</span> <span style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";font-weight:bold; color:#22B14C;'>Hyperic can also be used 
to improve the ‘restart’ time of many applications, which is particularly useful in large, complex N4 installations.
 </span> <span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";'>
 <br><br>
 The N4 Database Performance Pack provides improved visibility into the database setup and performance. As an advanced troubleshooting 
 tool, the performance pack interfaces provide diagnostic information, identify performance problems, and verify database configuration.
